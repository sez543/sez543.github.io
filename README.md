# Welcome to my GitHub!
The main page for sez543.github.io has not been finished yet. In the meantime feel free to check out my projects through the placehoder webpage or through this README file.
# My Projects (By relative date of creation)
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/blog">Static blog front-end</a> - My first comleted layout in HTML / CSS / JS back when I had just started my journey within the field. Created  for a web development course sometime in January last year. Colored version was also created.
- <a href="https://github.com/sez543/web-scraper">Chitanka.info Web Scraper</a> - A simple script which downloads all book from a given category. Created using NodeJS and Puppeteer. The website already offers such functionality, though it requires dowloading the entire library which you probably do not need. 
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/mandlebrot-set">Mandlebrot set Visualisation</a> - A rather simple visualization of the Mandlebrot set. Done by mapping each pixel to a complex value and iterating through it. Automatically downloads a high resolution image of the generated function on loadup.
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/julia-set-visualization">Julia set Visualisation</a> - Pretty much the same concept as the Mandlebrot set with included user interaction. Users are able to change the initial value over which to iterate and later on download the resulting image. Both of them were done using the P5js canvas library. 
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/flutter-simulation">Flutter simulation</a> - A 2D visualiation of the <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Flocking algorithm</a> (Boids) created by Craig Reynolds. This algorithm creates synchronised behaviour through three simple rules and is videly used in video games (For example the flying creatures in the original Half Life). Created with P5js and HTML canvas with added user control over the main parameters of the algorithm. The Advanced tab has not been finished.
- <a href="https://github.com/sez543/Simple-Calculator-Angular.js">Simple Angular.js Calculator</a>
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/chess">Angular.js Chess Engine</a> - A functional chess board suited for two player games. All the rules of chess (With a few notable exeptions) have been implemented, however the codebase needs some serious refactoring. I am planning to redo this concept with my current knowledge and a more modern technology stack. Possibly to add major functionalities from popular chess engines such as Lichess and Chess.com creating a solid foundation for AI support in the future. The wireframes for some of the pages are also included.
- <a href="https://github.com/sez543/DevCenter">DevCenter.org</a> - This is the final project from my web development course. A CMS platform for freelance especially tailored towards developers. My biggest project by that time since each page and its front-end / back-end logic was done by me (With the only exception being the styling for which I used Vue Material). Currently refactoring the codebase and porting my largely procedural logic into classes and objects.
- <a href="https://github.com/sez543/URL-Shortener-Laravel">PHP / Laravel URL Shorteners</a> - My introduction to API development with Laravel.
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/pathfinding">Pathfinding Visualisation</a> - A tool to display the inner workings of some of the most popular pathfinding algorithms.
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/snake">Snake</a> - A snake game created in VueJS with a retro-modern aesthetic.
- <a href="https://sez543.github.io/aim">Aim Practice</a> - One of my most recent projects. Created in VueJS with Vuex state emanagement and Vuetify for the styling.
