<h1 style="text-align:center;">My Projects (By relative date of creation)</h1>
<ul>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Static blog front-end</a> - My first comleted layout in HTML / CSS / JS back when I had just started my journey within the field. Created for an assignment for a web development course sometime in January last year. Colored version was also created.</h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Chitanka.info Web Scraper</a> - A simple script which downloads all book from a given category. Created using NodeJS and Puppeteer. The website already offers such functionality. However it requires dowloading the entire library the entirety of which you probably dont care too much about. </h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Mandlebrot set Visualisation</a> - A rether simple visualization of the Mandlebrot set. Done by mapping each pixel to a complex value and iterating through it. Automatically downloads a high resolution image of the generated function on loadup.</h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/julia-set-visualization">Julia set Visualisation</a> - Pretty much the same concept as the Mandlebrot set with included user interaction. Users are able to change the initial value over which to iterate and later on download the resulting image. Both of them were done using the P5js canvas library. </h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/flutter-simulation">Flutter simulation</a> - A 2D visualiation of the <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Flocking algorithm</a> (Boids) created by Craig Reynolds. This algorithm creates synchronised behaviour through three simple rules and is videly used in video game (For example the flying creatures in the xen level in the original Half Life). Created with P5js and HTML canvas with added user control over the main parameters of the algorithm. The Advanced tab has not been finished.</h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Simple Angular.js Calculator</a> - </h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Angular.js Chess Engine</a> - A functional chess board suited for two player games. All the rules of chess have been implemented, however the codebase needs some serious refactoring. I am planning to actually redo this concept with my current knowledge and a more modern technology stack. Possibly to add major functionalities from popular chess engines such as Lichess and Chess.com creating a solid foundation for AI support in the future. The wieframes for some of the pages are also included.</h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">DevCenter.org</a> - This is the final project from my web development course. A CMS platform for freelancy especially tailored toward develpers. My biggest project by that time since each page and its fron-end / back-end logic was done by me (With the only exception being the styling for which I used Vue Material). Currently refactoring the codebase and porting my largely procedural logic into classes and objects.</h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">PHP / Laravel URL Shorteners</a> - My introduction to API development with PHP and Laravel as a backend framework such as Laravel is something I wish to explore.</h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Pathfinding Visualisation</a> - A tool to display the inner workings of some of the most popular pathfinding algorithms. </h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Snake</a> - A snake game created in VueJS with a retro-modern eastetic.</h3></li>
<li><h3><a href="sez543.github.io/blog">Aim Practice</a> - One of my most recent projects. Created in VueJS with Vuex state emanagement and Vuetify for the styling. </h3></li>
</ul>
